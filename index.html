                 <p>IMPORTANT:</p>
                 <p>
                  If you are using mobile,zoom out the screen since for some
                  reason when this loads,your screen becomes a little bit zoomed
                  in
                  </p>
                  <p></p>                  
                   <p>
                    Alright,did you really think that I would just listen to you
                    and not give you anything for an actual farewell gift?
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>How naive of you.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Welp jokes on you,you already opened this and now have to
                    accept this.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I even made it as a tablet screen to keep your attention but
                    unfortunately the subway surfer videos are out of budget.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    To be fair this is more of a letter than a gift so I guess
                    you may have won somewhat,but I'm getting the final word
                    here so now just savor the masterpiece that I made just for
                    you.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    so we both won in our own ways,you didn't get an physical
                    gift and I was able to bury you with this letter. If I wrote
                    this on actual paper then I could wrap you in them like a
                    shawarma wrapper.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Not gonna lie,this letter is probably a bit scary for me to
                    be writing since I've decided that I'm gonna be a bit more
                    honest.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Hmm is it me becoming more honest or is it me just letting
                    my guard down?
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Remember back when you suddenly started questioning me about
                    why I still yap with you? I think that was the most serious
                    conversation that I've ever had with you. I'm not mentioning
                    this because I had any problems with it.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Honestly,I liked it since I get a better picture of what's
                    going on in your beautiful head.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Plus,it would be unfair to you if you're the only one
                    revealing their true thoughts,so that conversation is what
                    kinda gives me the motivation to be more honest and reveal
                    more of my thoughts.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I've probably said this a lot, but just to reiterate,thank
                    you for being friends with a guy like me and not going
                    insane.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Since it must really be hard having to think of the answers
                    to the most out of pocket questions like “what brand is your
                    microwave?” (answer this btw since I don't think I asked you
                    that question) lol.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Honestly,even if I didn't ask you all of these questions we
                    would still be friends.I would just have to think of a new
                    way to engage in convos with you.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Now I'll yap about some stuff that I wanted to either say to
                    you or do with you since now that I'm going back to the US,
                    those ideas/things I wanted to do will become harder and
                    discourages you from doing it just because I wanted it,which
                    looking back in hindsight is kinda dumb but still.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Now the reason for this is because I didn't want you to
                    solely do stuff that you seem to feel uncomfortable doing
                    just because of my whims. I feel like that I'd be
                    overstepping a few boundaries¹ which is why I've ultimately
                    kept this stuff in my head until now. Hmm I guess I could
                    call these as my regrets
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    1. Yapping with you via call or voice,since it makes it
                    easier for me to hear your emotions. Plus I think I'd be
                    able to bully/tease you way more easily and listening to
                    your voice is a blessing in itself. But for me to say that
                    myself it would be weird considering you already said that
                    you prefer text and you seem to be adverse to the idea
                    itself.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    2. Wanting to yap with you more in general. Honestly,I think
                    I'm being clingy and a bit selfish by saying this. Since I
                    know that you're busy and have stuff to do but I still miss
                    yapping with you for longer amounts of time. Nowadays,we
                    just speak less with a longer interval for every
                    conversation. Your reasons are completely valid and it's not
                    your fault but it still kinda hurts to have to wait for you.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I'm not saying that you should give me more time like how a
                    plant needs sunlight. This is more of me expressing myself
                    since while I do want more time with you,at the same time I
                    don't want more time with you since you're way busier than
                    me and time is already a valuable commodity,for you it's
                    even more valuable so you already giving some of your time
                    is enough. That's why I called myself selfish lol
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I still want to stay close to you without trying to be too
                    clingy. Honestly,in hindsight it was better that we began
                    speaking to each other after our 10th boards. While I do
                    pride myself on being mature,I would've definitely done
                    something stupid like how I did with Warda to you since I
                    was still immature and would've definitely hurt you. Thanks
                    to that whole mess with her,I actually matured a lot
                    especially in regards to this,otherwise I would've made a
                    mess a long time ago and wouldn't be writing this letter.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I wish I had decided to start working on this just a few
                    days before I left since I want to show this to you right
                    after I finish this project of mine. I should've been
                    lazier,but you know what? It worked out since usually I do
                    this stuff at the last minute,like those previous letters
                    and gifts that I gave you. While I think those letters were
                    good, as soon as I gave you those letters,I was overrun by
                    my inspiration and new ideas.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Usually whenever I'm giving you a letter,I have the main
                    idea in my head and then I write out the letter either on
                    the day that I'm going to give it to you or the day before
                    because of how lazy I can be. After I give you that letter,I
                    begin to ponder more about it and realise that there were
                    things that I could do that would make the letter even
                    better and then I wallow in my regrets.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Now,since I started this project a whole 15 days before my
                    departure,I've been able to constantly refine this project
                    over and over. For example,this paragraph that you're
                    reading right now has been rewritten with only eight days
                    left of me leaving.
                  </p>
                  <p>Honestly,I don't think I can stop writing</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Now,you’re probably wondering,why am I only going to send
                    this to you right before I get onto my first flight?
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Since I want to hold this final surprise as close to my
                    chest as possible before I chuck it to you full speed in the
                    head like a brick. This letter will probably be a
                    metaphorical brick in the head for you.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Plus,I want to read your replies and chat about it on the
                    plane heh. It'll make for something nice to read while I'm
                    on the plane.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I usually share everything that I hear,do,see and experience
                    with you except for the times in which I'm making these
                    gifts for you. Before I used to share by just typing
                    paragraphs and leaving daily voice messages while you were
                    gone but then it eventually evolved into me just telling you
                    whenever you're online. Hmm,because of that,I might forget
                    some stuff that I was going to tell you. But,I will
                    eventually tell you,once I do remember it lol. There's so
                    much that I want to yap to you about and my only limit is
                    the amount of time that you have.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Speaking of which,do you remember how I used to just spam
                    reels in your direct messages? I'm not sure if you noticed
                    it or not but I've stopped spamming them since I gradually
                    realised that
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1. You have stopped watching my reels for the most part
                    which is a betrayal of the highest level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2. With your attention span,you either don't see my messages
                    or just forget that they existed. Honestly,I think it's both
                    since they aren't mutually exclusive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    3. Since my time is limited with you,I might as well use it
                    to its fullest by yapping with you instead of sending you
                    reels.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    A few weeks ago,I had a fun conversation about you with
                    myself. Remember how I said to you how I would almost never
                    lie to you? I was thinking about what certain
                    situations/things that I would lie to you about. For the
                    record,this was a "what if" sort of thing,this mental
                    discussion is not the result of me thinking about actually
                    lying to you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From there,I realised that there would only be one thing
                    that I would lie to you about or something that would make
                    you ghost me. If you want to find out what that thing
                    is,then you're gonna have to ask me more questions about
                    myself ;).
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>So,from that discussion,I got another idea.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Why should I lie to you when I can do something even better
                    which is being super roundabout and confusing so you can't
                    determine the real answer. M'lady,you are smart yet
                    oblivious,something that is both a blessing and a curse for
                    me,since it's easier for you to get confused unless I'm
                    referring to it straightforwardly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Don't forget,oblivious and stupid are two different words
                    with two different meanings,so yes you can be smart and
                    oblivious. You think that oblivious means stupid which is
                    something that is actually stupid when it's an adjective
                    describing a person who just fails to notice certain things
                    or actions
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    An example of you being oblivious is when we were yapping in
                    whatsapp and I was trying to make you guess about the type
                    of plan that I had (it was the question website) and when
                    I'm trying to referring to explicit content indirectly so
                    you would get the hint but then since you're a concrete
                    brick,I have to say it more directly,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's lowkey fun watching you being so bad at guessing lol.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another example that would probably make more sense to you
                    would be the wooden doll Pinocchio lying to someone in one
                    of the Shrek movies.I'll send you the youtube link of that
                    scene after you finish reading this letter.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Another thing I've realized over time and over the course of
                    writing this letter is that I'm actually scared of losing
                    you. I know that you aren't the type of person to do such a
                    thing but that doesn't make the fear any less real lol.
                    You're practically embedded into my life at this point
                    rapidly with how synced we became with each other and you
                    suddenly disappearing forever would definitely be a not fun
                    experience for me. (let's be real,you always disappear all
                    the time but you do reappear)
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    You're one of very few people that I always speak to after
                    all. I know that you'll eventually leave one day, but I do
                    hope that you stay for a while more.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Since I'm just going to yapping for a while, what do you
                    actually think about me?
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    If you haven't already noticed,I usually make plans for a
                    lot of things and try to predict things using the
                    information that I have.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I however don't really have a plan for when you eventually
                    decide to leave since there would be too many variables and
                    I don't think I could stop you if you put your mind to it
                    sigh.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    From making that first website to making this letter to
                    making those pillars of text,I usually make my plans awhile
                    before I actually implement them.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    In fact,some topics that I mentioned in this letter weren't
                    suitable for me to mention in this letter so instead I just
                    removed those topics and then asked you in our
                    conversations. I'll list them out:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1. I first mentioned those small strips of paper that you
                    gave me before and asked you what I was supposed to do with
                    them here. I also said the same thing I said to you in that
                    conversation about eating them lol. The reason why I even
                    said that was to tease you by throwing such a curve ball at
                    you for your reaction. But what's the point of asking you in
                    this letter since I'll be gone and won't actually be able to
                    do anything.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    2. The "hypothetical" gift. I was originally planning on
                    consoling you that it was fine if you forgot about giving me
                    a gift. However,wouldn't that mean that I knew that you
                    wanted to give me a gift and didn't remind you on purpose?
                    So I removed that paragraph and decided to remind you
                    instead since if this happened to me,I would definitely be
                    upset, you would probably be upset aswell, and my brain got
                    a late dose of common sense. Sigh,I'm just too smart
                    sometimes.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    3. I mean it's not really a topic but more of a question
                    that I was going to ask you but then decided to just ask you
                    instead of waiting in here. "What's the longest thing that
                    you're ever read?" (Peak foreshadowing)
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    When I was first thinking about buying you a new gift,my
                    first idea was giving you a diary which is why I asked you
                    some questions like "what type of pages do you like?" and
                    just any question related to diaries so I know exactly what
                    type of diary I wanted to buy.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Since in case I disappear or we just stop talking,you'll
                    still be able to yap about your life in the diary and can
                    just vent out any of your pent-up emotions in it.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I wasn't going to plan on writing a letter like this at the
                    time that I locked in on the diary idea. It would be a
                    weaker version of this letter with the main body of that
                    letter being the paragraph above this one and then while I
                    would be writing it,I would just improvise my writing like
                    how I normally do.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    So,when I asked you what you would do after getting a new
                    diary,you said that you would allow it to collect dust by
                    chucking it on a shelf. Since I wanted my gift to be
                    something that you actually like or might find useful,I had
                    to think fast on possible gifts that I could give that you
                    would either like or would find useful or just be unique.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    So then I narrowed my options down to two things,a
                    binoculars worth ₹700 and a capsule clock that's ₹1600.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Since you love to roam around and want to explore the
                    world,I thought binoculars would be a good fit for you.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    And for the capsule clock,I just thought that it would look
                    nice on your desk that I don't know anything about,it was a
                    backup idea.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Speaking of gifts,I just got a new idea. A watch.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Hmm what kind of watch would you like would be the real
                    question.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I wonder,what color would suit your skin tone better? Gold
                    or Silver? Hmm since Gold could act as a contrast for it and
                    would make the watch stand out a bit and silver would give
                    you a more elegant and would blend in with your skin tone.
                    Since I can't really confirm your skin,I have an idea. How
                    much does your skin blend in with the color silver? If it
                    blends in nicely then you're white and if it contrasts then
                    you're more brown. I'm just guessing stuff so this idea of
                    mine probably won't be accurate. Am I able to give you gifts
                    even after going back if it is possible for me to do so?
                    (Sigh I know your answer will probably be no but it's well
                    worth a try.)
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Anyways,where was I?</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    The reason why I only mentioned those two gifts was due to
                    you saying that you didn't want a gift. Since you decided to
                    say no about me giving you a farewell gift,I stopped
                    brainstorming new possible gifts and then started to make
                    this website instead of writing a farewell letter so it
                    would be an actual farewell gift that you would have no
                    choice but to accept.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Since some concrete brick thought it was a good idea to
                    decide that the website that I made for you last time was my
                    farewell gift instead of letting me make an actual gift for
                    her,I wonder who they could possibly be?
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes,I just want to hit them with a chisel. Not gonna
                    lie,I wanted to write a letter to you by hand since I know
                    that you like handwritten and personal stuff. But thanks to
                    your refusal,you created this monster of almost 2,500 words.
                    I wonder how many words this letter is going to be by the
                    time you actually read this². I'm low key proud of myself
                    for being able to yap this much. As of June 19th,this would
                    take me at least 16 pages to write this out.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I started this project four days ago at the time of writing
                    this specific paragraph and I didn't start to make this
                    letter until I finished the work on the actual website
                    itself since if the website works then I could just copy
                    paste this entire letter.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    For this project,I used another C file in order to process
                    this letter. If you want to know more about the technical
                    details then you could read it in the footnotes³.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I've actually stopped playing games for the most part since
                    I'm working on this.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I even typed this all out with my laptop. I even took out
                    some of its keycaps while typing all of this since some of
                    the keys were moving slower than before and then blew into
                    it before putting it back. I think my typing speed actually
                    improved because of doing this.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes what I like to do is to just keep my head up,close
                    my eyes and continue typing since I'm good enough to type
                    without seeing the keyboard without making too many mistakes
                    and it just feels nice to do ngl while listening to music. I
                    stole that one song that you put in your note,"the city
                    holds my heart" and kept it in my playlist.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Writing letters is also a habit that I picked up from you.
                    The first letter I've ever written to a friend ever since I
                    came here was for you after all. I just realised that this
                    is also the first farewell letter that I've ever written as
                    well lol. You have both my first letter and my first
                    farewell letter.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Speaking of habits,over time I've begun to notice at what
                    times you usually come online. If you have college then you
                    would come online at 2-3:30pm, if you're with your relatives
                    or if they're with you then you would be online late at
                    night or in the early morning. If you're doing your
                    extracurricular activities,then it would be in the
                    evening,like around 7-8pm. If the academic season began and
                    you had holidays,then you would become active in the
                    afternoon,usually at the time of Zuhr.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I say usually since I'm recounting this all from my
                    memories,plus there's no actual set time for you to come
                    online,so this is just the pattern that I've noticed. If I
                    sold all of the info that I have on you, just how much would
                    it be worth?
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Now,this is the part in which I clarify that I'm not a
                    stalker and that I just have the habits of one. Since I may
                    act like a stalker,I've always respected your privacy.
                    Plus,there's nothing for me to gain if I actually try to
                    stalk you since I can always ask you directly. Additionally
                    I'm not insecure enough to do such a thing. Also,yes I'm
                    jobless but not jobless enough to log every time you become
                    online ;-;
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I'm just too handsome and smart to be insecure. You see,if I
                    repeat this over and over,it'll become real. This is
                    actually known as the placebo effect and is definitely not
                    me using my narcissism as a coping mechanism.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    If I remember correctly,the first compliment that I ever
                    gave you was by calling you an enigma. Now,I'm going to
                    explain what an enigma is and how you're an enigma to me.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    The definition of an enigma is "a person or thing that is
                    mysterious or difficult to understand." according to oxford.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    For me,you are indeed mysterious in a way since there's
                    always something that I didn't know about you before and
                    then you just casually tell me lol. Like how you told me
                    that you knew how to make those jewelry with those beads.how
                    you were also good at swimming etc. (Since knowing
                    you,there's probably more lol)
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    The "difficult to understand" part doesn't apply to you
                    since I can understand you for the most part.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    In hindsight,enigma isn't often a word used to compliment
                    people but it's still a compliment for you in my opinion.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Also when did you first start using slang like innit? That's
                    something I've always wanted to ask but forgot to since you
                    stopped using it or just use it less nowadays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You're the only person that I've ever known that uses the
                    word innit which is interesting,how and when exactly did you
                    start to use it?
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    You're the only person who seems to have moved into my head
                    with how many thoughts I have about you. I think the most
                    dreams that I've ever had that are related to a person or
                    has a person was you for this year and maybe last year.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Remember,I told you in the very beginning that I gave you my
                    trust and would only take it back if there was a reason to
                    and that I wouldn't never be the one who would stop talking
                    first. I intend on staying true to that to the very end,so
                    don't even think about getting rid of me so soon.9
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Do you know what my highlight of last year was? Meeting you
                    was the best thing that ever happened to me last year. At
                    that time I was already suspicious of him when we first met
                    and you gave me enough evidence for me to be able to cut off
                    that snake. From there we went from strangers to kindred
                    souls.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I'd like to thank you for all of the time that you've given
                    me,for always being ready to listen to my yapping. You're
                    actually the only person that I can yap about secrets for
                    more than one reason,so you're kinda like a safe area for me
                    in that regard. You made my life better by just existing
                    since yapping with you makes me happy. I thank my Lord for
                    all of this.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    These aren't compliments,so don't think of them like that.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>This is the truth for me.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    You're one of the most beautiful people that I know and that
                    says something especially when I've never seen your face
                    after 10th. Your beauty doesn't need to be seen for others
                    to be noticed. You're a hard working person and are super
                    productive once you put your mind into it which is something
                    that I both lack but still admire. I should be the one
                    feeling inferior here,not you.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    You put the desires of others before your own desires and
                    are a compassionate person for children. Your voice is
                    timeless,just like your public speaking skills. Honestly,you
                    could improve it even more if you become an extrovert but
                    you being an introvert and having a good skill level is
                    already amazing with you being you.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    You call yourself boring which is understandable since you
                    already know everything about yourself or are just chill
                    enough to forget yourself,but for me you're the complete
                    opposite,like if I have to pick a color that reminds me of
                    you then I would say brown. Not the boring type of brown,but
                    a coffee-hazelnut brown since I feel like it would be you
                    the most,you're a mix of everything after all. I do get
                    tired of people.I realised this when I was fighting with my
                    parents about having to say farewell to my relatives,but I
                    don't think I can get tired of you,even if I had multiple
                    lifetimes.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>As a friend of yours,I ask you this.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    To stop prioritizing others and to instead prioritize
                    yourself. Ultimately it is your life. If you do not voice
                    your opinion about it then you are only breathing,not
                    living.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Your life is far too valuable to be used and wasted in such
                    a heedless manner. If you want to waste it,then at least be
                    the one that wastes it.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Is it really worth hurting yourself for those that do not
                    deserve your kindness and constantly abuse it? Just bite
                    their ankles instead of being a pushover.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    To believe in yourself more. I'm not going to give you the
                    typical motivation monologue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I've been your shadow for awhile now after,so even though I
                    may make some mistakes while saying this,I will still be
                    right mostly.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Academically, you always work hard and underestimate
                    yourself,which is honestly better than my situation,since
                    that ability will serve you well in your higher studies.
                    Most of us natural geniuses cruise through life and then
                    eventually burn out during high school since we've been
                    relying on our natural talent this entire time instead of
                    putting in any actual effort.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So then when the time comes for us to actually put in all of
                    that effort,we start to get stuck and lose confidence in
                    ourselves.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    You are different in this regard since you'll actually have
                    a better life once you finish this system that relies on
                    rote memorization since your skills will finally be able to
                    spread their wings in an actual college for your higher
                    studies.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    For us,it becomes harder towards the end but for the likes
                    of you it actually becomes easier since you're already used
                    to working hard and actually studying.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Appearance-wise, I honestly can't really say anything since
                    I can't see you,but I definitely have faith in your beauty.
                    I'm not trying to give lip service or to just say this for
                    the sake of it. Beauty is actually a subjective
                    standard,which means that it depends on the person since
                    their standards could easily be different from one another.
                    So,just because you think you're ugly or some other people
                    think you're ugly doesn't mean that you aren't beautiful in
                    my eyes or in the eyes of others. Oh yeah,stop hating on
                    your looks,out of the two of us, I should be the one crying
                    to you about looks ;-;

                  <p>Life-wise?</p>
                  <p>
                    Don't lose hope in yourself and your life in general,Allah
                    azzawajal doesn't burden a soul more than what it can
                    bear,with hardship comes ease and whenever he closes a door
                    for you,he opens another. Even if it's hopeless,don't give
                    up and persevere,if not for your own sake but for the sake
                    of your Lord.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    As long as you survive you will have the potential to do
                    whatever you want one day.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Remember,I'll always be there for you and that someone will
                    always be looking out and will care about everything that
                    you do or happens to you,even if it's something as trivial
                    as stubbing your toe.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I'd gladly help you out with anything but I'm not sure if
                    you would actually ask for my help. I am mostly sure that I
                    won't be the first person you ask for help since my capacity
                    to help will be reduced.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Hmm,I should make you promise that you'll ask me for help
                    whenever you need help or just anything in general. There
                    are other people around you or that you know who would be
                    glad to help you as well so don't forget that.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Remember to take care of yourself well and stay safe. That
                    includes you being safe from yourself and to have more
                    confidence in yourself and to stop undervaluing yourself.
                    Just become a narcissist since unlike me,you actually have
                    the looks to be one and it would boost your confidence in
                    yourself since narcissism is just an excessive amount of
                    self-love.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I tell you that you're unique all the time,which is the
                    truth. Nobody else can be you after all. You learnt four
                    languages; English,Hindi,Urdu and Arabic. You're good at so
                    many different things like swimming,skating,basketball,DIY
                    jewelry,public speaking,and etc since I could've forgotten
                    some or there are other hobbies of yours that I don't know.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Sure,it's not like you're the only person who learns those
                    things,but who else other than you has all of the qualities
                    and things that I mentioned earlier? Sure,it's not like you
                    specialized in any one hobby but as the saying goes; A jack
                    of all trades,master of none but better than a master of
                    one.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I'd love to say more but I gotta balance my honesty keeping
                    you in mind,since as much as I do care and adore you,I don't
                    want to scare you away and lose you because of the weight of
                    my feelings. I actually had to revise this letter and remove
                    400 words and change some sentences. I still have that
                    version and might send it to you depending on how things go
                    lol.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I ask for your forgiveness if any of my past behavior has
                    wronged you in any way or if I ever offended you seriously.
                    This also extends to anything I said in this letter as well.
                    This is a prime opportunity for me to say this to without
                    you thinking that I'm suicidal lol.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    When you read this letter,I want you to know that I'm not
                    angry at you or anything like that so don't misunderstand my
                    words. I wrote all of this warmth so I could smother you to
                    death.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    The reason for me saying this is because as you know very
                    well,I don't really use emojis so you aren't able to know
                    the tone of my words. Sometimes you would think that I was
                    angry when I wasn't.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    So,since I don't really know how to make the tone of this
                    letter apparent by using emojis,I’ll leave it up to you to
                    interpret the tone of this letter. Let me know what your
                    interpretation is since I honestly don't know how to
                    actually vocalize the tone lol.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I've also said this before but since you're so good at
                    forgetting,I'll say it again. You can't make me angry. Like
                    the only time that you made me a bit annoyed was when you
                    were late when we were exchanging books at the cgt bus stop
                    and we misunderstood stuff. So,don't think that I'm angry or
                    upset at you anywhere in this letter or I'll actually become
                    upset lol.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I think I've said enough and that it's finally time for me
                    to wrap things up. Since,I have run out of things to say for
                    now and knowing you,by the time you reach this sentence,you
                    would've forgotten the beginning.

                  <p>What better way to give a farewell than to use a poem.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>A knight who bleeds,</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>his spilled blood adorned by the sun’s light.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Conquering land by sword or pen,</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>his ink dries,</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    but his blood still flows hot with the vigor of the sun.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Yet his homeland sings to him—</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>a land bereft of a sun.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>His creed demands his presence,</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>but his heart craves the Sun's warmth.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    The path is clear as he struggles to cast off the light.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Alas, he hardens his heart</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>and bids farewell to his sun.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>His march begins,</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>one without the light of the sky’s lantern.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>A knight journeying home.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>A sun blazes bright,</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>leaving a tall shadow on the knight—</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>one that merges into his own.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>The knight now carries a gaze in his shadow—</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>The quiet gaze of a sun who never left.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>I bid you my farewell M'lady.</p>
                  <p></p>

                    ¹:What are those boundaries? It's basically what I perceive
                    as the boundaries of our relationship,so it'd be more
                    accurate for it to be called the boundaries of this
                    relationship. Since I feel like that if I go beyond these
                    boundaries, I might overwhelm or detrimentally affect you.
                    If you ask me to elaborate then idk how.

                  <p>
                    1. Lazy loading,instead of the entire page loading at
                    once,when you reach the bottom it loads more of the page
                    along with other optimizations done to reduce any lag or
                    performance issues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2. Switch toggle that let's you choose between the animation
                    playing out or you using lazy loading to read the letter
                    without having to wait for the animation.

                  <p>
                    3. Password: Who doesn't love a password? Originally I was
                    going to make it zohra or a word similar to it since that's
                    what I named in my contacts before I turned you into yousuf.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But since you said "wardati",the password is now wardati.
                    Don't sweat it since either way the password was going to be
                    flower's English transliteration of Arabic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I just made it the one that you associated with it. Btw the
                    reason why I chose zohra instead of a different name for you
                    at the time was because it had warda's name and I didn't to
                    keep that name for you considering what happened between you
                    and them.

                    June 23rd=5389 words || Removed m'lady which was used three
                    times and replaced it with your name and then reverted the
                    changes after you gave your reason. But I forgot one of the
                    places where I changed it so now one less word exists.

                    June 24th=5412 words || Today,I'll be uploading the final
                    version of both the code and everything that I've written.
                    My typing speed improved from 50-60 wpm to 70 wpm because of
                    this which is an unexpected bonus.
                    As of 7:34pm,the zoom in bug has reappeared for mobile
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    ³:Since if I use a single paragraph tag for this entire
                    letter,I wouldn't be able to space the paragraphs properly
                    so instead I decided to use a C file to wrap every paragraph
                    of my words with paragraph tags instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If there's an empty space then it makes a tag with nothing
                    inside of it to give a line of space.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>For example,</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Input=test | output=&lt;p&gt;test&lt;/p&gt;</p>
                  <p>input= | output=&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
                  <p>test | &lt;p&gt;test&lt;/p&gt;</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    The angle brackets that you see aren't actually angle
                    brackets,since if I actually use them,it would be
                    interpreted as actual code and then an error would occur. So
                    instead I wrote them in a way that the system wouldn't
                    interpret it as actual code.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Now,you're probably wondering,why did I originally pick a
                    tombstone for the design of this website?
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I wanted to reenact the engraved look of a tombstone and
                    wanted the text to have the same ancient type of vibe.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I was planning on adding some flower bouquets to this
                    tombstone,some of them being yours and the others being mine
                    from that question that I asked that was along the lines of
                    "What flowers would you want at your funeral?"
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    But the problem was that the flowers didn't look good enough
                    and I couldn't actually turn them into a bouquet. Plus with
                    the typing animation running it would've looked ugly so
                    instead I just decided to remove it entirely.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    The "tombstone" looked like a slightly burnt white wall and
                    even after applying some special effects it still looked
                    like pigeon shit and I couldn't engrave the text like how I
                    wanted to do so originally.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    After some further thought,I decided to turn the tombstone
                    into a tablet screen since it didn't look as good as I
                    wanted it to and it didn't match the vibe I wanted. Sigh
                    expectations versus reality type of shit. The tablet version
                    looks a lot better on both computer and on mobile.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'll revisit this idea once I get better at coding since
                    this idea is definitely possible once I learn more.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally,I replaced the typing animation with a simple
                    load in animation since it was taking too long for this
                    letter to fully be animated,at least being over 15
                    minutes,with some performance issues as well. Honestly the
                    load-in animation looks a lot better,is clean and only takes
                    up 2-3 minutes.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Plus,before due to the typing animation,there was an issue
                    in viewing this website on mobile. On mobile,when the
                    website loads,you would already be zoomed in and would have
                    to zoom out manually to see it properly. See more at bug
                    notes
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    All of these changes made for a good minimalist vibe since I
                    removed all of the complex stuff and turned back to
                    simplicity.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    I've reread the entire letter more than once to make sure
                    that there aren't any mistakes but since I might miss some
                    stuff,I used chatgpt for checking the letter to see if I
                    made any mistakes like with the tone and my choice of words
                    and google docs for basic spelling and grammar mistakes
                    since it's more efficient.

                  <p>Bug log:</p>
                  <p>1. Description of the bug:</p>
                  <p>
                    Basically if you open the website on mobile,for some reason
                    it'll be a bit zoomed in so you have to zoom out with your
                    fingers to see this in all of it's full glory
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Update:This occurred after June 13th and I don’t have an
                    exact date since I was writing this as of June 18th. That
                    bug has made a return since I had to change the tablet
                    screen's dimensions from dynamic to static.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Update#2:June 18th,made it dynamic again since when I tested
                    it by locally hosting it with my laptop it was working
                    fine,so once again that bug disappeared
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Static means that the dimensions like height,width,length
                    are locked in and that their values won’t change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dynamic means that depending on the content in the box,the
                    height,width,and length would change to fit the content in
                    the box.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>2. Description of the bug:</p>
                  <p>
                    When the entire text animation finished loading,the entire
                    screen would become white due to improper CSS.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    -----------------------------------------------------------
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Originally for the poem,I was going to use a statue instead
                    of a knight but a statue cannot move and a knight can.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    So I changed it to a knight. So as a bonus,you get to see
                    the statue poem
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>A statue standing strong.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Waiting for the warmth of the Sun.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Yet stands in a razed forest.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Patiently waiting for the Sun's grace.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Yet slowly crumbles with the winds of change.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>A statue knowing that the Sun will set.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>The moss slowly covering its eyes,</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>yet the Sun's light cannot be blocked.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>A statue waiting.</p>
                  <p></p>
