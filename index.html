                <p>
                  Alright,you really thought that I would just listen to you and
                  not give you anything for an actual farewell gift?
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>How naive of you.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Welp jokes on you,you already opened this and now have to
                  accept this.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I even made it as a tablet screen to keep your attention but
                  unfortunately the subway surfer videos are out of budget.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  To be fair this is more of a letter than a gift so I guess you
                  may have won somewhat,but I'm getting the final word here so
                  now just savor the masterpiece that I made just for you.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Not gonna lie,this letter is probably a bit scary for me to be
                  writing since I've decided that I'm gonna be a bit more
                  honest.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Hmm is it me becoming more honest or is it me just letting my
                  guard down?
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Remember back when you suddenly started questioning me about
                  why I still yap with you? I think that was the most serious
                  conversation that I've ever had with you. I'm not mentioning
                  this because I had any problems with it.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Honestly,I liked it since I get a better picture of what's
                  going on in your beautiful head.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Plus,it would be unfair to you if you're the only one
                  revealing their true thoughts,so that conversation is what
                  kinda gives me the motivation to be more honest and reveal
                  more of my thoughts.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I've probably said this a lot, but just to reiterate,thank you
                  for being friends with a guy like me and not going insane.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Since it must really be hard having to think of the answers to
                  the most out of pocket questions like “what brand is your
                  microwave?” (answer this btw since I don't think I asked you
                  that question) lol.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Honestly,even if I didn't ask you all of these questions we
                  would still be friends.I would just have to think of a new way
                  to engage in convos with you.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Now I'll yap about some stuff that I wanted to either say to
                  you or do with you since now that I'm going back to the US,
                  those ideas/things I wanted to do will become harder and
                  discourages you from doing it just because I wanted it,which
                  looking back in hindsight is kinda dumb but still.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Now the reason for this is because I didn't want you to solely
                  do stuff that you seem to feel uncomfortable doing just
                  because of my whims. I feel like that I'd be overstepping a
                  few boundaries¹ which is why I've ultimately kept this stuff
                  in my head until now. Hmm I guess I could call these as my
                  regrets
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  1. Yapping with you via call or voice,since it makes it easier
                  for me to hear your emotions. Plus I think I'd be able to
                  bully/tease you way more easily and listening to your voice is
                  a blessing in itself. But for me to say that myself it would
                  be weird considering you already said that you prefer text and
                  you seem to be adverse to the idea itself.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  2. Wanting to yap with you more in general. Honestly,I think
                  I'm being clingy and a bit selfish by saying this. Since I
                  know that you're busy and have stuff to do but I still miss
                  yapping with you for longer amounts of time. Nowadays,we just
                  speak less with a longer interval for every conversation. Your
                  reasons are completely valid and it's not your fault but it
                  still hurts having to wait for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sigh, I'm not sure if I even have the right to say all of this
                  or me to even feel hurt about this, but it's better than
                  keeping this pent-up and then letting it burst.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I still want to stay close to you without trying to be too
                  clingy. That pain is honestly the only thing I dislike about
                  this. It makes me want to say words or actions to you that I
                  will definitely regret after doing so. You're probably the
                  only person that makes me feel like this thankfully. Like the
                  only similar situation I've had with this was the one with
                  Warda which was honestly a good one for me. Thanks to that
                  mess, I became more mature about that stuff. Anyways, enough
                  of this.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  3. Not meeting you sooner. Ngl I wonder how different our
                  lives would've been if we met earlier (???)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I wish I had decided to start working on this just a few days
                  before I left since I want to show this to you right after I
                  finish this project of mine. I should've been lazier,but you
                  know what? It worked out since usually I do this stuff at the
                  last minute,like those previous letters and gifts that I gave
                  you. While I think those letters were good, as soon as I gave
                  you those letters,I was overrun by my inspiration and new
                  ideas. Now,since I started this project a whole 15 days before
                  my departure,I've been able to constantly refine this project
                  over and over. For example,this paragraph that you're reading
                  right now has been rewritten with only eight days left of me
                  leaving.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Now,you’re probably wondering,why am I only going to send this
                  to you right before I get onto my first flight?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since I want to hold this final surprise as close to my chest
                  as possible before I chuck it to you full speed in the head
                  like a brick. This letter will probably be a metaphorical
                  brick in the head for you.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Plus,I want to read your replies and chat about it on the
                  plane heh. It'll make for something nice to read while I'm on
                  the plane.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I usually share everything that I hear,do,see and experience
                  with you except for the times in which I'm making these gifts
                  for you. Before I used to share by just typing paragraphs and
                  leaving daily voice messages while you were gone but then it
                  eventually evolved into me just telling you whenever you're
                  online. Hmm,because of that,I might forget some stuff that I
                  was going to tell you. But,I will eventually tell you,once I
                  do remember it lol. There's so much that I want to yap to you
                  about and my only limit is the amount of time that you have.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Speaking of which,do you remember how I used to just spam
                  reels in your direct messages? I'm not sure if you noticed it
                  or not but I've stopped spamming them since I gradually
                  realised that
                </p>
                <p>
                  1. You have stopped watching my reels for the most part which
                  is a betrayal of the highest level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. With your attention span,you either don't see my messages
                  or just forget that they existed. Honestly,I think it's both
                  since they aren't mutually exclusive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Since my time is limited with you,I might as well use it to
                  its fullest.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  A few weeks ago,I had a fun conversation about you with
                  myself. Remember how I said to you how I would almost never
                  lie to you? I was thinking about what certain
                  situations/things that I would lie to you about. For the
                  record,this was a "what if" sort of thing,this mental
                  discussion is not the result of me thinking about actually
                  lying to you. From there,I realised that there would only be
                  one thing that I would lie to you about or something that
                  would make you ghost me. If you want to find out what that
                  thing is,then you're gonna have to ask me more questions about
                  myself ;).
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>So,from that discussion,I got another idea.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Why should I lie to you when I can do something even better
                  which is being super roundabout and confusing so you can't
                  determine the real answer. You,m'lady are smart yet
                  oblivious,something that is both a blessing and a curse for
                  me,since it's easier for you to get confused unless I'm
                  referring to it straightforwardly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Don't forget,oblivious and stupid are two different words with
                  two different meanings,so yes you can be smart and oblivious.
                  You think that oblivious means stupid which is something that
                  is actually stupid when it's an adjective describing a person
                  who just fails to notice certain things or actions
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  An example of you being oblivious is when we were yapping in
                  whatsapp and I was trying to make you guess about the type of
                  plan that I had (it was the question website) and when I'm
                  trying to referring to explicit content indirectly so you
                  would get the hint but then since you're a concrete brick,I
                  have to say it more directly,
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's lowkey fun watching you being so bad at guessing lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another example that would probably make more sense to you
                  would be the wooden doll Pinocchio lying to someone in one of
                  the Shrek movies.I'll send you the youtube link of that scene
                  after you finish reading this letter.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Another thing I've realized over time and over the course of
                  writing this letter is that I'm actually scared of losing you.
                  I know that you aren't the type of person to do such a thing
                  but that doesn't make the fear any less real lol. You're
                  practically embedded into my life at this point rapidly with
                  how synced we became with each other and you suddenly
                  disappearing forever would definitely be a not fun experience.
                  (let's be real,you always disappear all the time but you do
                  reappear)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  You're one of very few people that I always speak to after
                  all. I know that you'll eventually leave one day, but I do
                  hope that you stay for a while more.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Since I've decided to let my guard down a bit with you,It's a
                  good time for me to ask you about how you view me and what are
                  your actual thoughts about me.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  If you haven't already noticed,I usually make plans for a lot
                  of things and try to predict things using the information that
                  I have.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I however don't really have a plan for when you eventually
                  decide to leave I figured that I should just let life work
                  it's magic and improvise or just go with the flow.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  From making that first website to making this letter to making
                  those pillars of text,I usually make my plans awhile before I
                  actually implement them.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  When I was first thinking about buying you a new gift,my first
                  idea was giving you a diary which is why I asked you some
                  questions like "what type of pages do you like?" and just any
                  related diary question.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Since in case I disappear or we just stop talking,you'll still
                  be able to yap about your life in the diary and can just vent
                  out any of your pent-up emotions in it.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I wasn't going to plan on writing a letter like this at the
                  time that I locked in on the diary idea. It would be a weaker
                  version of this letter with the main body of that letter being
                  the paragraph above this one and then while I would be writing
                  it,I would just improvise my writing like how I normally do.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Usually I do this stuff all the time and then after doing
                  it,my brain gets super-inspired and then I would just mope in
                  the regret of not adding the ideas that I had.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  So,when I asked you what you would do after getting a new
                  diary,you said that you would allow it to collect dust by
                  chucking it on a shelf.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I had to think fast on possible gifts that I could give that
                  you would either like or would find useful or just be unique.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  So I narrowed my options down to two things,a binoculars worth
                  ₹700 and a capsule clock that's ₹1600.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Since you love to roam around and want to explore the world,I
                  thought binoculars would be a good fit for you.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  And for the capsule clock,I just thought that it would look
                  nice on your desk that I don't know anything about,it was a
                  backup idea.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Speaking of gifts,I just got a new idea. A watch.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Hmm what kind of watch would you like would be the real
                  question.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I wonder,what color would suit your skin tone better? Gold or
                  Silver? Hmm since Gold could act as a contrast for it and
                  would make the watch stand out a bit and silver would give you
                  a more elegant and would blend in with your skin tone. Since I
                  can't really confirm your skin,I have an idea. How much does
                  your skin blend in with the color silver? If it blends in
                  nicely then you're white and if it contrasts then you're more
                  brown. I'm just guessing stuff so this idea of mine probably
                  won't be accurate. Am I able to give you gifts even after
                  going back if it is possible for me to do so? (Sigh I know
                  your answer will probably be no but it's well worth a try.)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Anyways,where was I?</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Since you decided to say no about me giving you a farewell
                  gift,I stopped brainstorming new possible gifts and then
                  started to make this website instead of writing a farewell
                  letter so it would be an actual farewell gift that you would
                  have no choice but to accept. Since some concrete brick
                  thought it was a good idea to decide that the website that I
                  made for you last time was my farewell letter.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes,I just want to hit them with a chisel. Not gonna
                  lie,I kinda wanted to write a letter to you by hand since I
                  know that you like handwritten and personal stuff. But thanks
                  to your refusal,you created this monster of almost 2,500
                  words. I wonder how many words this letter is going to be by
                  the time you actually read this². I'm low key proud of myself
                  for being able to yap this much.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I started this project four days ago at the time of writing
                  this specific paragraph and I didn't start to make this letter
                  until I finished the work on the actual website itself since
                  if the website works then I could just copy paste this entire
                  letter.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  For this project,I used another C file in order to process
                  this letter. If you want to know more about the technical
                  details then you could read it in the footnotes³.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I've actually stopped playing games for the most part since
                  I'm working on this.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I even typed this all out with my laptop. I even took out some
                  of its keycaps while typing all of this since some of the keys
                  were moving slower than before and then blew into it before
                  putting it back. I think my typing speed actually improved
                  because of doing this.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes what I like to do is to just keep my head up,close
                  my eyes and continue typing since I'm good enough to type
                  without seeing the keyboard without making too many mistakes
                  and it just feels nice to do ngl while listening to music. I
                  stole that one song that you put in your note,"the city holds
                  my heart" and kept it in my playlist.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Writing letters is also a habit that I picked up from you. The
                  first letter I've ever written to a friend ever since I came
                  here was for you after all. I just realised that this is also
                  the first farewell letter that I've ever written as well lol.
                  You have both my first letter and my first farewell letter.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Speaking of habits,over time I've begun to notice at what
                  times you usually come online. If you have college then you
                  would come online at 2-3:30pm, if you're with your relatives
                  or if they're with you then you would be online late at night
                  or in the early morning. If you're doing your extracurricular
                  activities,then it would be in the evening,like around 7-8pm.
                  If the academic season began and you had holidays,then you
                  would become active in the afternoon,usually at the time of
                  Zuhr.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I say usually since I'm recounting this all from my
                  memories,plus there's no actual set time for you to come
                  online,so this is just the pattern that I've noticed. If I
                  sold all of the info that I have on you, just how much would
                  it be worth?
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Now,this is the part in which I clarify that I'm not a stalker
                  and that I just have the habits of one. Since I may act like a
                  stalker,I've always respected your privacy. Plus,there's
                  nothing for me to gain if I actually try to stalk you since I
                  can always ask you directly. Additionally I'm not insecure
                  enough to do such a thing.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I'm just too handsome and smart to be insecure. You see,if I
                  repeat this over and over,it'll become real. This is actually
                  known as the placebo effect and is definitely not me using my
                  narcissism as a coping mechanism.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  If I remember correctly,the first compliment that I ever gave
                  you was by calling you an enigma. Now,I'm going to explain
                  what an enigma is and how you're an enigma to me.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  The definition of an enigma is "a person or thing that is
                  mysterious or difficult to understand." according to oxford.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  For me,you are indeed mysterious in a way since there's always
                  something that I didn't know about you before and then you
                  just casually tell me lol. Like how you told me that you knew
                  how to make those jewelry with those beads.how you were also
                  good at swimming etc. (Since knowing you,there's probably more
                  lol)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  The "difficult to understand" part doesn't apply to you since
                  I can understand you for the most part.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  In hindsight,enigma isn't really a word used to compliment
                  people but it's still a compliment in my opinion.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Also when did you first start using slang like innit? That's
                  something I've always wanted to ask but forgot to since you
                  stopped using it or just use it less nowadays.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You're the only person that I've ever known that uses the word
                  innit which is interesting,how and when exactly did you start
                  to use it?
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  You're the only person who seems to have moved into my head
                  with how many thoughts I have about you. I think the most
                  dreams that I've ever had that are related to a person or has
                  a person was you for this year and maybe last year.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Remember,I told you in the very beginning that I gave you my
                  trust and would only take it back if there was a reason to and
                  that I wouldn't never be the one who would stop talking first.
                  I intend on staying true to that to the very end,so don't even
                  think about getting rid of me so soon.9
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Do you know what my highlight of last year was? Meeting you
                  was the best thing that ever happened to me last year. At that
                  time I was already suspicious of him when we first met and you
                  gave me enough evidence for me to be able to cut off that
                  snake. From there we went from strangers to kindred souls.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I'd like to thank you for all of the time that you've given
                  me,for always being ready to listen to my yapping. You're
                  actually the only person that I can yap about secrets for more
                  than one reason,so you're kinda like a safe area for me in
                  that regard. You made my life better by just existing since
                  yapping with you makes me happy. I thank my Lord for all of
                  this.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  These aren't compliments,so don't think of them like that.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>This is the truth for me.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  You're one of the most beautiful people that I know and that
                  says something especially when I've never seen your face after
                  10th. Your beauty doesn't need to be seen for others to be
                  noticed. You're a hard working person and are super productive
                  once you put your mind into it which is something that I both
                  lack but still admire. I should be the one feeling inferior
                  here,not you.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  You put the desires of others before your own desires and are
                  a compassionate person for children. Your voice is
                  timeless,just like your public speaking skills. Honestly,you
                  could improve it even more if you become an extrovert but you
                  being an introvert and having a good skill level is already
                  good enough.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  You call yourself boring which is understandable since you
                  already know everything about yourself or are just chill
                  enough to forget yourself,but for me you're the complete
                  opposite,like if I have to pick a color that reminds me of you
                  then I would say brown. Not the boring type of brown,but a
                  coffee-hazelnut brown since I feel like it would be you the
                  most,you're a mix of everything after all. I get tired of
                  people in general,not a specific person and even if I did get
                  tired of people, I couldn't get tired of you even if I had
                  multiple lifetimes.

                <p>As a friend of yours,I ask you this.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  To stop prioritizing others and to instead prioritize
                  yourself. Ultimately it is your life. If you do not voice your
                  opinion about it then you are only breathing,not living.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Your life is far too valuable to be used and wasted in such a
                  heedless manner. If you want to waste it,then at least be the
                  one that wastes it.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Is it really worth hurting yourself for those that do not
                  deserve your kindness and constantly abuse it? Just bite their
                  ankles instead of being a pushover.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  To believe in yourself more. I'm not going to give you the
                  typical motivation monologue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've been your shadow for awhile now after,so even though I
                  may make some mistakes while saying this,I will still be right
                  mostly.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Academically, you always work hard and underestimate
                  yourself,which is honestly better than my situation,since that
                  ability will serve you well in your higher studies. Most of us
                  natural geniuses cruise through life and then eventually burn
                  out during high school since we've been relying on our natural
                  talent this entire time instead of putting in any actual
                  effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So then when the time comes for us to actually put in all of
                  that effort,we start to get stuck and lose confidence in
                  ourselves.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  You are different in this regard since you'll actually have a
                  better life once you finish this system that relies on rote
                  memorization since your skills will finally be able to spread
                  their wings in an actual college for your higher studies.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  For us,it becomes harder towards the end but for the likes of
                  you it actually becomes easier since you're already used to
                  working hard and actually studying.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Appearance-wise, I honestly can't really say anything since I
                  can't see you,but I definitely have faith in your beauty. I'm
                  not trying to give lip service or to just say this for the
                  sake of it. Beauty is actually a subjective standard,which
                  means that it depends on the person since their standards
                  could easily be different from one another. So,just because
                  you think you're ugly or some other people think you're ugly
                  doesn't mean that you aren't beautiful in my eyes or in the
                  eyes of others. Oh yeah,stop hating on your looks,out of the
                  two of us, I should be the one crying to you about this ;-;
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Life-wise?</p>
                <p>
                  Don't lose hope in yourself and your life in general,Allah
                  azzawajal doesn't burden a soul more than what it can
                  bear,with hardship comes ease and whenever he closes a door
                  for you,he opens another. Even if it's hopeless,don't give up
                  and persevere,if not for your own sake but for the sake of
                  your Lord m'lady.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Remember,I'll always be there for you and that someone will
                  always be looking out and will care about everything that you
                  do or happens to you,even if it's something as trivial as
                  stubbing your toe.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I'd gladly help you out with anything but I'm not sure if you
                  would actually ask for my help. I am mostly sure that I won't
                  be the first person you ask for help since my capacity to help
                  will be reduced.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Hmm,I should make you promise that you'll ask me for help
                  whenever you need help or just anything in general. There are
                  other people around you or that you know who would glad to
                  help you aswell so don't forget that.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Remember to take care of yourself well and stay safe. That
                  includes you being safe from yourself and to have more
                  confidence in your self and to stop undervaluing yourself.
                  Just become a narcissist since unlike me,you actually have the
                  looks to be one and it would boost your confidence in yourself
                  since narcissism is just an excessive amount of self-love.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I'd love to say more but I gotta balance my honesty keeping
                  you in mind,since as much as I do care and adore you,I don't
                  want to scare you away and lose you because of the weight of
                  my feelings. I actually had to revise this letter and remove
                  400 words and change some sentences. I still have that version
                  and might send it to you depending on how things go lol
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I ask for your forgiveness if any of my past behavior has
                  wronged you in any way or if I ever offended you seriously.
                  This also extends to anything I said in this letter as well.
                  This is a prime opportunity for me to say this to without you
                  thinking that I'm suicidal lol.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  When you read this letter,I want you to know that I'm not
                  angry at you or anything like that so don't misunderstand my
                  words. I wrote all of this warmth so I could smother you to
                  death.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  The reason for me saying this is because as you know very
                  well,I don't really use emojis so you aren't able to know the
                  tone of my words. Sometimes you would think that I was angry
                  when I wasn't.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  So,since I don't really know how to make the tone of this
                  letter apparent by using emojis,I’ll leave it up to you to
                  interpret the tone of this letter. Let me know what your
                  interpretation is since I honestly don't know how to actually
                  vocalize the tone lol.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I've also said this before but since you're so good at
                  forgetting,I'll say it again. You can't make me angry. Like
                  the only time that you made me a bit annoyed was when you were
                  late when we were exchanging books at the cgt bus stop and we
                  misunderstood stuff. So,don't think that I'm angry or upset at
                  you anywhere in this letter or I'll become upset. (Yes,me
                  becoming upset is an extinction-level disaster for you and you
                  shouldn't let that happen.)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I think I've said enough and that it's finally time for me to
                  wrap things up. Since,I have run out of things to say for now
                  and knowing you,by the time you reach this sentence,you
                  would've forgotten the beginning.
                </p>

                <p>A knight who bleeds,</p>

                <p></p>

                <p></p>
                <p>His creed demands his presence,</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>but his heart craves the Sun's warmth.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The path is clear as he struggles to cast off the light.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Alas, he hardens his heart</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>and bids farewell to his sun.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>His march begins,</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>one without the light of the sky’s lantern.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A knight journeying home.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A sun blazes bright,</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>leaving a tall shadow on the knight—</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>one that merges into his own.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The knight now carries a gaze in his shadow—</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The quiet gaze of a sun who never left.</p>
                <p></p>

                  What are those boundaries? It's basically what I perceive as
                  the boundaries of our relationship,so it'd be more accurate
                  for it to be called the boundaries of this relationship. Since
                  I feel like that if I go beyond these boundaries, I might
                  overwhelm or detrimentally affect you.

                  ³:Since if I use a single paragraph tag for this entire
                  letter,the spacing wouldn't be proper. So what the C file does
                  is wrap each line with tags.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  If there's an empty space then it makes a tag with nothing
                  inside of it.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>For example,</p>
                <p></p>

Input=test | output=&lt;p&gt;test&lt;/p&gt;

                  Now,you're probably wondering,why did I pick a tombstone for
                  the design?
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Since I wanted to have the engraved look of one and since it seemed to be a good design choice at the time
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Honestly I can't wait for your reaction.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  (There is a possible chance that you do not realise that this
                  thing is supposed to be a tombstone)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Originally,I was going to add some flower bouquets to this
                  tombstone,some of them being yours and the others being mine.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  But the problem was that the flowers didn't look good enough
                  and I couldn't actually turn them into a bouquet. Plus with
                  the typing animation running it would've looked ugly so
                  instead I just decided to remove it entirely.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  After some further thought,I decided to turn the tombstone
                  into a tablet screen since it didn't look as good as I wanted
                  it to and it didn't match the vibe I wanted. Sigh expectations
                  versus reality type of shit. The tablet version looks alot
                  better. I'll revisit this idea once I get better at coding,
                </p>
                <p>Honestly,the tablet screen one matches the vibe better than this
                and just looks so much better overall    
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally,I replaced the typing animation with a simple
                  load in animation since it was taking too long for this letter
                  to fully be animated,atleast being over 15 minutes,with some
                  proformance issues aswell. Honestly the load-in animation
                  looks a lot better,is clean and only takes up 2-3 minutes.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Plus,before due to the typing animation,there was an issue in
                  viewing this website on mobile. On mobile,when the website
                  loads,you would already be zoomed in and would have to zoom
                  out manually to see it properly.

                  Update:June 13th or after since I'm writing this as of June
                  18th,that error has made a return since I had to change the
                  screen's dimensions from dynamic to static.
                  Update#2:June 18th,made it dynamic again.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  What I do to check for minor errors like grammar and spelling
                  is to paste the entire letter in google docs so it could find
                  it for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The app that I'm using to write this all is called obsidian
                  and ngl it's nice.

                <p>
                  Originally for the poem,I was going to use a statue instead of
                  a knight but a statue cannot move and a knight can.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  So I changed it to a knight. So as a bonus,you get to see the
                  statue poem
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A statue standing strong.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Waiting for the warmth of the Sun.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Yet stands in a razed forest.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Patiently waiting for the Sun's grace.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Yet slowly crumbles with the winds of change.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A statue knowing that the Sun will set.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The moss slowly covering its eyes,</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>yet the Sun's light cannot be blocked.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A statue waiting.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
