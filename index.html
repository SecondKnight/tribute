                <p>IMPORTANT:</p>
                <p>
                  If you are using mobile,zoom out the screen since for some
                  reason when this loads,your screen becomes a little bit zoomed
                  in
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Alright,you really thought that I would just listen to you and
                  not give you anything for an actual farewell gift?
                </p>
                <p>How naive of you.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Honestly,I wanted to give you a gift that you would actually
                  use in your daily life and to give a farewell letter with it
                  since I know you like handwritten stuff (99% sure). But
                  noooooooo,you don't want me to gift you anything and have the
                  gall to try to change the intention of the gift I made for
                  you.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Welp jokes on you,you already opened this and now have to
                  accept this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To be fair this is more of a letter than a gift so I guess you
                  may have won somewhat,but I'm getting the final word here so
                  now enjoy my monologue on random shit.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Not gonna lie,this letter is probably a bit scary for me to be
                  writing since I've decided that I'm gonna be bit more honest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hmm is it me becoming more honest or is it me just letting my
                  guard down. Since I feel like if I yapped like how I would
                  normally yap with you then it might affect the relationship
                  that I have with you.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Remember back when you suddenly started questioning me about
                  why I still yap with you? I think that was the most serious
                  conversation that I've ever had with you. I'm not mentioning
                  this because I had any problems with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Honestly,I liked it since I get a better picture of what's
                  going on in your beautiful head.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Plus,it would be unfair to you if you're the only one
                  revealing their true thoughts,so that conversation is what
                  kinda gives me the motivation to be more honest and revealing
                  more of my thoughts.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I've probably said this a lot, but just to reiterate,thank you
                  for being friends with a guy like me and not going insane.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  It must really be hard having to think of the answers to the
                  most out of pocket questions like what brand is your microwave
                  is (answer this btw since I don't think I asked you that
                  question)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Now I'll yap about some stuff that I wanted to either say to
                  you or do with you since now that I'm going those ideas/things
                  I wanted to do that will either be impossible to do or will be
                  harder. Now the reason for this is because I didn't want you
                  to solely do stuff that you seem to feel uncomfortable doing
                  just because of my whims. I feel like that I'd be overstepping
                  a few boundaries¹ which is why I've ultimately kept this stuff
                  in my head until now. Hmm I guess I could call these as my
                  regrets
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  1. Yapping with you via call or voice,since it makes it easier
                  for me to hear your emotions. Plus I think I'd be able to
                  bully/tease you way more easily and listening to your voice is
                  a blessing in itself. But for me to say that myself it would
                  be weird considering you already saying that you prefer text
                  and you seeming to be adverse to the idea itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  (Action)((ngl I need help atp with the way I just categorize
                  stuff lol))
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  2. Wanting to yap with you more in generally. Honestly,I think
                  this is just me being clingy and greedy ig,welp fuck it we
                  ball. Since before,we were both lazy bums and I'd be able to
                  yap with you 24/7 and now we cant since you've become busy and
                  soon I'm about to join you in being busy and now with
                  time-zones we might yap even less.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sigh and I still want to stay close to you lol. Eh atp I'm
                  used to waiting,a bit more waiting wouldn't hurt. Btw if it
                  isn't already clear,I'm not blaming you at all in this letter
                  since I know your reasons,whatever they are are definitely
                  valid,plus it'd be selfish of me to say all of this when ik
                  you have your reasons (words)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  3. Not meeting you sooner. Ngl I wonder how different our
                  lives would've been if we met earlier (???)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Hmm I should've listened to my inner voice telling me to be
                  lazy and to do this just before I go. Since now I want to
                  share this with you like how I share everything else when
                  there are 15 whole days left. I usually share everything I do
                  to you since it makes for a good conversation topic. Before I
                  would just yap about it by making a wall of text each time or
                  a voice message like how I was always updating you about my
                  life. Now I just prefer dumping it on you when I know you're
                  online. Unfortunately that makes me forget some stuff that I
                  planned to tell you lol.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  A while ago,like maybe a few weeks ago I was thinking about
                  the possible scenarios of me lying to you. Not because I
                  wanted to lie to you or was planning on lying to you lol.
                  Actually,I take the latter part of that last sentence back
                  since that's just me thinking about when I should lie to you
                  which comes under "planning on lying to you". So then I came
                  to the conclusion that the only reason I would lie to you
                  about something would be because of you or because of the bond
                  we built up so I don't get ghosted the next day.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  The subject of that lie would be about me in some way like if
                  you asked me a certain question or relating to it in some way.
                  Now,what would that question be? Well,it'd be a shame for you
                  to get the answer directly so how about you try asking more
                  questions to me lol ;).
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  (I'll use emoticons and tone indicators in this letter so you
                  don't get confused about the tone of this letter and then say
                  that I'm just angry at you. Maybe I should become a psychic
                  with these predictions of mine)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Ultimately at the end of my mental dialogue,I decided to just
                  not lie and instead be super roundabout and subtle about it
                  like how politicians never give a straight answer when they're
                  asked a simple question and they're just supposed to say yes
                  or no but then go on a rant on a completely different topic.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Now,you're probably wondering,why would I do such mental
                  gymnastics while yapping with you? Because,you m'lady are
                  oblivious and it's a perfect strategy to counter you.
                  Oblivious does not mean dumb so I'm not calling you dumb,it
                  simply means that you just don't notice some things which is
                  ngl a blessing in disguise for me heh.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Another thing I've realized over time and over the course of
                  writing this letter is that I'm kinda scared of losing you. I
                  know that you aren't the type of person to do such a thing but
                  that doesn't make the fear any less real lol. You're
                  practically embedded into my life at this point rapidly with
                  how synced we became with each other.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  You're one of very few people that I always speak to after
                  all. I know that you'll eventually leave but I hope that you
                  take as long as possible to leave
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Since I've decided let my guard down a bit with you,It's a
                  good time for me to ask you about how you view me and what are
                  your actual thoughts about me.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  If you haven't already noticed,I usually make plans for a lot
                  of things and try to predict things using the information that
                  I have.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From making that first website to making this letter to making
                  those pillars of text,I usually make my plans awhile before I
                  actually implement them.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I planned on writing this letter as in a normal letter
                  originally with a decent diary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since I wanted you to start writing things that you wanted to
                  remember,about the feelings that you feel and to just serve as
                  an appropriate medium for you to vent to. My rationale behind
                  this was so that you could release any of your pent-up
                  emotions in a better way since it isn't healthy to have them
                  pent-up. This entire paragraph was originally supposed to the
                  main thing of that letter and from there I would improvise and
                  make it.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Welp plans changed so this letter changed and eventually I got
                  the idea to make this letter in it's place

                  Writing letters is also a habit that I picked up from you. The
                  first letter I've ever written to a friend ever since I came
                  here was for you after all. I just realised that this is also
                  the first farewell letter that I've ever written aswell lol.
                  You have both my first letter and my first farewell latter.

                  Also when did you first start using slang like innit? That's
                  something I've always wanted to ask but forgot to since you
                  stopped using it or just use it less nowadays.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That was the first time that I've ever seen anyone use innit
                  while texting lol
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  You're the only person who seems to have moved into my head
                  with how many thoughts I have about you.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Remember,I told you in the very beginning that I gave you my
                  trust and would only take it back if there was a reason to and
                  that I wouldn't never be the one who would stop talking first.
                  I intend on staying true to that to the very end.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I thank you for the time that you've given me.</p>
                <p>I thank you for always being here with me.</p>
                <p>i thank you for being a safe place for me.</p>
                <p>I thank you for the joy that you have given me.</p>
                <p>I thank you for being a friend to a person like me.</p>
                <p>I thank my Lord for creating you.</p>
                <p>
                  I thank my Lord for making all of these events create such a
                  beautiful outcome.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  These aren't compliments,so don't think of them of like that.
                </p>
                <p>This is the truth for me.</p>
                <p>
                  You are one of most beautiful people that I have ever seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You are one of the most hard working and productive people
                  that I have ever known.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You are a person who prioritizes others over themselves and
                  has a selfless personality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You are the most interesting person that I have ever known,as
                  opposed to your own opinion that you are just a boring person
                </p>
                <p>You are a gift to this world and it's children.</p>
                <p>
                  You are a person that I would never get tired of being with.
                </p>
                <p>You are the only person that I would do all of this for.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>As a friend of yours,I ask you this.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  To stop prioritizing others and to instead prioritize
                  yourself. Ultimately it is your life. If you do not voice your
                  opinion about it then you are only breathing,not living.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your life is far too valuable to be used and wasted in such a
                  heedless manner. If you want to waste it,then at least be the
                  one that wastes it.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Remember,I'll always be there for you and that someone will
                  always be looking out and will care about everything that you
                  do or happens to you,even if it's something as trivial as
                  stubbing your toe.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I'd love to say more but I gotta balance my honesty keeping
                  you in mind,since as much I do care and adore you,I don't want
                  to scare you away and lose you because of the weight of my
                  feelings. I actually had to revise this letter and remove 400
                  words lol.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I bid you farewell M'lady</p>

              ¹: What are my boundaries? Honestly,it's not my boundaries. It's
              basically what I perceive as the boundaries of our relationship,so
              it'd be more accurate for it to be called the boundaries of this
              relationship. Since I feel like that if I go beyond these
              boundaries, I might overwhelm or detrimentally affect you. Hmm
              maybe I really am becoming schizophrenic over this. This entire
              thing is just my pent-up overthinking
