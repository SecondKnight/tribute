                <p>
                  Alright,you really thought that I would just listen to you and
                  not give you anything for an actual farewell gift?
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>How naive of you.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Welp jokes on you,you already opened this and now have to
                  accept this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I even made it as a tablet screen to keep your attention but
                  unfortunately the subway surfer videos are out of budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To be fair this is more of a letter than a gift so I guess you
                  may have won somewhat,but I'm getting the final word here so
                  now just savor the masterpiece that I made just for you.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Not gonna lie,this letter is probably a bit scary for me to be
                  writing since I've decided that I'm gonna be a bit more
                  honest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hmm is it me becoming more honest or is it me just letting my
                  guard down?
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Remember back when you suddenly started questioning me about
                  why I still yap with you? I think that was the most serious
                  conversation that I've ever had with you. I'm not mentioning
                  this because I had any problems with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Honestly,I liked it since I get a better picture of what's
                  going on in your beautiful head.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Plus,it would be unfair to you if you're the only one
                  revealing their true thoughts,so that conversation is what
                  kinda gives me the motivation to be more honest and reveal
                  more of my thoughts.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I've probably said this a lot, but just to reiterate,thank you
                  for being friends with a guy like me and not going insane.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Since it must really be hard having to think of the answers to
                  the most out of pocket questions like “what brand is your
                  microwave?” (answer this btw since I don't think I asked you
                  that question) lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Honestly,even if I didn't ask you all of these questions we
                  would still be friends.I would just have to think of a new way
                  to engage in convos with you.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Now I'll yap about some stuff that I wanted to either say to
                  you or do with you since now that I'm going back to the US,
                  those ideas/things I wanted to do will become harder and
                  discourages you from doing it just because I wanted it,which
                  looking back in hindsight is kinda dumb but still.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now the reason for this is because I didn't want you to solely
                  do stuff that you seem to feel uncomfortable doing just
                  because of my whims. I feel like that I'd be overstepping a
                  few boundaries¹ which is why I've ultimately kept this stuff
                  in my head until now. Hmm I guess I could call these as my
                  regrets
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  1. Yapping with you via call or voice,since it makes it easier
                  for me to hear your emotions. Plus I think I'd be able to
                  bully/tease you way more easily and listening to your voice is
                  a blessing in itself. But for me to say that myself it would
                  be weird considering you already said that you prefer text and
                  you seem to be adverse to the idea itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  (Action)((ngl I need help atp with the way I just categorize
                  stuff lol))
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  2. Wanting to yap with you more in general. Honestly,I think
                  this is just me being clingy and greedy ig,welp fuck it we
                  ball. Since before,we were both lazy bums and I'd be able to
                  yap with you 24/7 and now we can't since you've become busy
                  and soon I'm about to join you in being busy and now with
                  time-zones we might yap even less.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Sigh and I still want to stay close to you lol without trying
                  to be too clingy. Welp at this point I'm used to waiting for
                  you,a bit more waiting wouldn't hurt. Btw if it isn't already
                  clear,I'm not blaming you at all in this letter since I know
                  your reasons,whatever they are are definitely valid,plus it'd
                  be selfish of me to say all of this when I know you have your
                  reasons (words)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  3. Not meeting you sooner. Ngl I wonder how different our
                  lives would've been if we met earlier (???)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Hmm I should've listened to my inner voice telling me to be
                  lazy and to do this just before I go. Since now I want to
                  share this with you like how I share everything else when
                  there are 15 whole days left. I usually share everything I do
                  with you since it makes for a good conversation topic. Before
                  I would just yap about it by making a wall of text each time
                  or a voice message like how I was always updating you about my
                  life. Now I just prefer dumping it on you when I know you're
                  online. Unfortunately that makes me forget some stuff that I
                  planned to tell you lol.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  A while ago,like maybe a few weeks ago I was thinking about
                  the possible scenarios of me lying to you. Not because I
                  wanted to lie to you or was planning on lying to you lol.
                  Actually,I take the last part of that last sentence back since
                  that's just me thinking about when I should lie to you which
                  comes under "planning on lying to you". So then I came to the
                  conclusion that the only reason I would lie to you about
                  something would be because of you or because of the bond we
                  built up so I don't get ghosted the next day.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  The subject of that lie would be about me in some way like if
                  you asked me a certain question or relating to it in some way.
                  Now,what would that question be? Well,it'd be a shame for you
                  to get the answer directly so how about you try asking more
                  questions to me lol ;).
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Ultimately at the end of my mental dialogue,I decided to just
                  not lie and instead be super roundabout and subtle about it
                  like how politicians never give a straight answer when they're
                  asked a simple question and they're just supposed to say yes
                  or no but then go on a rant on a completely different topic.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Now,you're probably wondering,why would I do such mental
                  gymnastics while yapping with you? Because,you m'lady are
                  oblivious and it's a perfect strategy to counter you.
                  Oblivious does not mean dumb so I'm not calling you dumb,it
                  simply means that you just don't notice some things which is
                  both a blessing and a curse.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Another thing I've realized over time and over the course of
                  writing this letter is that I'm kinda scared of losing you. I
                  know that you aren't the type of person to do such a thing but
                  that doesn't make the fear any less real lol. You're
                  practically embedded into my life at this point rapidly with
                  how synced we became with each other.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  You're one of very few people that I always speak to after
                  all. I know that you'll eventually leave one but I hope that
                  you stay for a while more.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Since I've decided to let my guard down a bit with you,It's a
                  good time for me to ask you about how you view me and what are
                  your actual thoughts about me.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  If you haven't already noticed,I usually make plans for a lot
                  of things and try to predict things using the information that
                  I have.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From making that first website to making this letter to making
                  those pillars of text,I usually make my plans awhile before I
                  actually implement them.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  When I was first thinking about buying you a new gift,my first
                  idea was giving you a diary which is why I asked you some
                  questions like "what type of pages do you like?" and just any
                  related diary question.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since in case I disappear or we just stop talking,you'll still
                  be able to yap about your life in the diary and can just vent
                  out any of your pent-up emotions in it.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I wasn't going to plan on writing a letter like this at the
                  time that I locked in on the diary idea. It would be a weaker
                  version of this letter with the main body of that letter being
                  the paragraph above this one and then while I would be writing
                  it,I would just improvise my writing like how I normally do.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Usually I do this stuff all the time and then after doing
                  it,my brain gets super-inspired and then I would just mope in
                  the regret of not adding the ideas that I had.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  So,when I asked you what you would do after getting a new
                  diary,you said that you would just let collect dust by
                  chucking it on a shelf.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I had to think fast on possible gifts that I could give that
                  you would either like or would find useful or just be
                  unique.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  So I narrowed my options down to two things,a binoculars worth
                  ₹700 and a capsule clock that's ₹1600.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since you love to roam around and want to explore the world,I
                  thought binoculars would be a good fit for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And for the capsule clock,I just thought that it would look
                  nice on your desk that I don't know anything about,it was a
                  backup idea.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Speaking of gifts,I just got a new idea. A watch.</p>
                <p>
                  Hmm what kind of watch would you like would be the real
                  question.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I wonder,what color would suit your skin tone better? Gold or
                  Silver? Hmm since Gold could act as a contrast for it and
                  would make the watch stand out a bit and silver would give you
                  a more elegant and would blend in with your skin tone. Since I
                  can't really confirm your skin,I have an idea. How much does
                  your skin blend in with the color silver? If it blends in
                  nicely then you're white and if it contrasts then you're more
                  brown. I'm just guessing stuff so this idea of mine probably
                  won't be accurate. Am I able to give you gifts even after
                  going back if it is possible for me to do so? (Sigh I know
                  your answer will probably be no but it's well worth a try.)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Anyways,where was I?</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Since you decided to say no about me giving you a farewell
                  gift,I stopped brainstorming new possible gifts and then
                  started to make this website instead of writing a farewell
                  letter so it would be an actual farewell gift that you would
                  have no choice but to accept. Since some concrete brick
                  thought it was a good idea to decide that the website that I
                  made for you last time was my farewell letter.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes,I just want to hit them with a chisel. Not gonna
                  lie,I kinda wanted to write a letter to you by hand since I
                  know that you like handwritten and personal stuff. But thanks
                  to your refusal,you created this monster of almost 2,500
                  words. I wonder how many words this letter is going to be by
                  the time you actually read this². I'm low key proud of myself
                  for being able to yap this much.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I started this project four days ago and didn't start making
                  this letter until I finished the work on the actual website
                  itself since if the website works then I could just copy paste
                  this entire letter.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  For this project,I used another C file in order to process
                  this letter. If you want to know more about the technical
                  details then you could read it in the footnotes³.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I've actually stopped playing games for the most part since
                  I'm working on this.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I even typed this all out with my laptop. I even took out some
                  of its keycaps while typing all of this since some of the keys
                  were moving slower than before and then blew into it before
                  putting it back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes what I like to do is to just keep my head up,close
                  my eyes and continue typing since I'm good enough to type
                  without seeing the keyboard without making too many mistakes
                  and it just feels nice to do ngl.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Writing letters is also a habit that I picked up from you. The
                  first letter I've ever written to a friend ever since I came
                  here was for you after all. I just realised that this is also
                  the first farewell letter that I've ever written as well lol.
                  You have both my first letter and my first farewell letter.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  If I remember correctly,the first compliment that I ever gave
                  you was by calling you an enigma. Now,I'm going to explain
                  what an enigma is and how you're an enigma to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The definition of an enigma is "a person or thing that is
                  mysterious or difficult to understand." according to oxford.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For me,you are indeed mysterious in a way since there's always
                  something that I didn't know about you before and then you
                  just casually tell me lol. Like how you told me that you knew
                  how to make those jewelry with those beads.how you were also
                  good at swimming etc. (Since knowing you,there's probably more
                  lol)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  The "difficult to understand" part doesn't apply to you since
                  I can understand you for the most part.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  In hindsight,enigma isn't really a word used to compliment
                  people but it's still a compliment in my opinion.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Also when did you first start using slang like innit? That's
                  something I've always wanted to ask but forgot to since you
                  stopped using it or just use it less nowadays.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That was the first time that I've ever seen anyone use innit
                  while texting lol
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  You're the only person who seems to have moved into my head
                  with how many thoughts I have about you. I think the most
                  dreams that I've ever had that are related to a person or has
                  a person was you for this year and maybe last year.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Remember,I told you in the very beginning that I gave you my
                  trust and would only take it back if there was a reason to and
                  that I wouldn't never be the one who would stop talking first.
                  I intend on staying true to that to the very end.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Do you know what my highlight of last year was? Meeting you
                  was the best thing that ever happened to me last year. At that
                  time I was already suspicious of him when we first met and you
                  gave me enough evidence for me to be able to cut off that
                  snake. From there we went from strangers to kindred souls.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I'd like to thank you for all of the time that you've given
                  me,for always being ready to listen to my yapping. You're
                  actually the only person that I can yap about secrets for more
                  than one reason,so you're kinda like a safe area for me in
                  that regard. You made my life better by just existing since
                  yapping with you makes me happy. I thank my Lord for all of
                  this.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  These aren't compliments,so don't think of them like that.
                </p>
                <p>This is the truth for me.</p>
                <p>
                  You're one of the most beautiful people that I know and that
                  says something especially when I've never seen your face after
                  10th. Your beauty doesn't need to be seen for others to
                  notice. You're a hard working person and are super productive
                  once you put your mind into it which is something that I both
                  lack but still admire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You put the desires of others before your own desires and are
                  a compassionate person for children. Your voice is
                  timeless,just like your public speaking skills. Honestly,you
                  could improve it even more if you become an extrovert but you
                  being an introvert and having a good skill level is already
                  good enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You call yourself boring which is understandable since you
                  already know everything about yourself or are just chill
                  enough to forget yourself,but for me you're the complete
                  opposite,like if I have to pick a color that reminds me of you
                  then I would say brown. Not the boring type of brown,but a
                  coffee ish hazelnut brown since I feel like it would be you
                  the most. I get tired of people in general,not a specific
                  person and I couldn't get tired of you even if I tried.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>As a friend of yours,I ask you this.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  To stop prioritizing others and to instead prioritize
                  yourself. Ultimately it is your life. If you do not voice your
                  opinion about it then you are only breathing,not living.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your life is far too valuable to be used and wasted in such a
                  heedless manner. If you want to waste it,then at least be the
                  one that wastes it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Is it really worth hurting yourself for those that do not
                  deserve your kindness and constantly abuse it? Just bite their
                  ankles instead of being a pushover.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Don't lose hope in yourself,Allah azzawajal doesn't burden a
                  soul more than what it can bear and whenever he closes a door
                  for you,he opens another. Even if it's hopeless,don't give up
                  and persevere. Trust in your Lord m'lady.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I'd gladly help you out with anything but I don't think you
                  would ask me for help. Hmm,I should make you promise that
                  you'll ask me for help whenever you need help or just anything
                  in general. I'm sure that I'm not the only one that echoes
                  this sentiment and that someone will at least help you even if
                  I didn't exist.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Remember,I'll always be there for you and that someone will
                  always be looking out and will care about everything that you
                  do or happens to you,even if it's something as trivial as
                  stubbing your toe.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I'd love to say more but I gotta balance my honesty keeping
                  you in mind,since as much as I do care and adore you,I don't
                  want to scare you away and lose you because of the weight of
                  my feelings. I actually had to revise this letter and remove
                  400 words and change some sentences. I still have that version
                  and might send it to you depending on how things go lol
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  When you read this letter,I want you to know that I'm not
                  angry at you or anything like that so don't misunderstand my
                  words. The reason for me saying this is because as you know
                  very well,I don't really use emojis so you aren't able to know
                  the tone of my words. Sometimes you would think that I was
                  angry when I wasn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So,since I don't really know how to make the tone of this
                  letter apparent by using emojis,I’ll leave it up to you to
                  interpret the tone of this letter. Let me know what your
                  interpretation is since I honestly don't know how to actually
                  vocalize the tone lol.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I've also said this before but since you're so good at
                  forgetting,I'll say it again. You can't make me angry. Like
                  the only time that you made me a bit annoyed was when you were
                  late when we were exchanging books at the cgt bus stop and we
                  misunderstood stuff. So,don't think that I'm angry or upset at
                  you anywhere in this letter or I'll become upset. (Yes,me
                  becoming upset is an extinction-level disaster for you and you
                  shouldn't let that happen.)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  When you finish reading this letter,can you gimme more than a
                  few words for a response since it's a bit hard for me to cook
                  up over 3000 words and I want to know more on what you think
                  of this.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  I think I've said enough and that it's finally time for me to
                  wrap things up. If I continue writing this out then you might
                  forget the beginning.

                <p>What better way to give a farewell than to use a poem.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A knight who bleeds,</p>
                <p>his spilled blood adorned by the sun’s light.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Conquering land by sword or pen,</p>
                <p>his ink dries,</p>
                <p>but his blood still flows hot with the vigor of the sun.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Yet his homeland sings to him—</p>
                <p>a land bereft of a sun.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>His creed demands his presence,</p>
                <p>but his heart craves the Sun's warmth.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The path is clear as he struggles to cast off the light.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Alas, he hardens his heart</p>
                <p>and bids farewell to his sun.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>His march begins,</p>
                <p>one without the light of the sky’s lantern.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A knight journeying home.</p>
                <p>A sun blazes bright,</p>
                <p>leaving a tall shadow on the knight—</p>
                <p>one that merges into his own.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The knight now carries a gaze in his shadow—</p>
                <p>The quiet gaze of a sun who never left.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I bid you my farewell M'lady.</p>
                <p>فِي أَمَانِ اللَّهِ</p>
                <p></p>

                  What are those boundaries? It's basically what I perceive as
                  the boundaries of our relationship,so it'd be more accurate
                  for it to be called the boundaries of this relationship. Since
                  I feel like that if I go beyond these boundaries, I might
                  overwhelm or detrimentally affect you.

                  Hmm maybe I really am becoming schizophrenic over this. This
                  entire thing is just my pent-up overthinking

                  ²:I started this from June 5th lol. So the total word count
                  went from 1,500 to 2,300 thousand words and then after I had
                  to remove some stuff it became 1900ish words. At the time that
                  I'm currently writing this footnote,it's 2575 words. Also I'm
                  not including the footnotes in the word count. I'll add
                  date-stamps of the total word count starting from June 8th
                </p>
                <p>June 8th=1900 words || The culling incident</p>
                <p>June 9th=2635 words ||</p>
                <p>June 10th=2815 words || Working on a poem</p>
                <p>
                  June 11th=2972 words || poem has been added,187 words removed
                  and stuffed into footnote 3

                  ³:Since if I use a single paragraph tag for this entire
                  letter,the spacing wouldn't be proper. So what the C file does
                  is wrap each line with
                </p>
                <p>tags.</p>
                <p>
                  If there's an empty space then it makes a tag with nothing
                  inside of it.
                </p>
                <p>For example,</p>

Input=test | output=&lt;p&gt;test&lt;/p&gt;

                  Now,you're probably wondering,why did I pick a tombstone for
                  the design?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I felt like it would look cool and to foreshadow my possible
                  death since I don't really know how you'll react to this at
                  all.
                </p>
                <p>Honestly I can't wait for your reaction.</p>
                <p>
                  (There is a possible chance that you do not realise that this
                  thing is supposed to be a tombstone)
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Originally,I was going to add some flower bouquets to this
                  tombstone,some of them being yours and the others being mine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the problem was that the flowers didn't look good enough
                  and I couldn't actually turn them into a bouquet. Plus with
                  the typing animation running it would've looked ugly so
                  instead I just decided to remove it entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After some further thought,I decided to turn the tombstone
                  into a tablet screen since it didn't look as good as I wanted
                  it to. Sigh expectations versus reality type of shit. The
                  tablet version looks alot better. I'll revisit this idea once
                  I get better at coding,
                </p>
                  <p>
                   Additionally,I replaced the typing animation with a simple
                  load in animation since it was taking too long for this letter
                  to fully be animated,atleast being over 15 minutes,with some
                  proformance issues aswell. Honestly the load-in animation
                  looks a lot better,is clean and only takes up 2-3 minutes.
                  </p>
                <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Plus,before due to the typing animation,there was an issue in
                  viewing this website on mobile. On mobile,when the website
                  loads,you would already be zoomed in and would have to zoom
                  out manually to see it properly.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  Originally for the poem,I was going to use a statue instead of
                  a knight but a statue cannot move and a knight can.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So I changed it to a knight. So as a bonus,you get to see the
                  statue poem
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A statue standing strong.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Waiting for the warmth of the Sun.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Yet stands in a razed forest.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Patiently waiting for the Sun's grace.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Yet slowly crumbles with the winds of change.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A statue knowing that the Sun will set.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The moss slowly covering its eyes,</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>yet the Sun's light cannot be blocked.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A statue waiting.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
